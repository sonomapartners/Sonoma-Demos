Remote Objects
===

This is a demonstration of the basics of [Remote Objects](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.pages.meta/pages/pages_remote_objects.htm), a new feature that became generally available in the Winter '15 release.

To run this demo, you will need a Salesforce organization which can be obtained for free from their [developer website](https://developer.salesforce.com/).

This demo assumes a working knowledge of Visualforce, HTML, and Javascript already.
